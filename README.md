	Author: EinBaum (known as Bulldozer @ Emerald Dream)

###About

	Shows a swing timer bar on your screen.
	Notice: Works only for warriors who use one weapon. No support for other classes or offhand weapons.

	This Addon was created to abuse a common bug on private servers where it's possible to hit with your autoattack while casting Slam. There's a text file called "SLAM MACRO.txt" that has a macro to help cast Slam at the right time.
	This Addon is still useful as a normal swing timer even if this bug is fixed on your server.

###Features

	- Attempts to calculate swing timer after Parry. Info: http://www.wowwiki.com/Parry
	- Bar color changes when the remaining swing time is lower than the casting time of Slam.
	- In-combat weapon swap support. Swing time gets set back if you swap your weapon in combat.
